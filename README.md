Bullet hell/danmaku game inspired by Touhou project made with [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) using C# bindings from [raylib-cs](https://github.com/raylib-cs/raylib-cs). <br><br>
Native renderer backend written on C, because rendering directly with C# causes stuttering issues. Check [NativeRenderer](https://github.com/ryhunwashere/NativeRenderer), which I made it myself.
