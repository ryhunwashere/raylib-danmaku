Drawing orders to keep track of. Higher layers will be drawn on top of the lower ones:
private const int PLAYER_BULLET_LAYER = 1;
private const int ENEMY_BULLET_LAYER = 2;
private const int PLAYER_BEAM_LAYER = 3;
private const int ENEMY_BEAM_LAYER = 4;


Debugging notes to keep remind myself in case something doesn't appear, so I won't feel so stupid:
"DO NOT FORGET TO CALL THE Draw() FUNCTION IN Game.DrawGame()"
"DO NOT FORGET TO CALL THE Draw() FUNCTION IN Game.DrawGame()"
"DO NOT FORGET TO CALL THE Draw() FUNCTION IN Game.DrawGame()"
"DO NOT FORGET TO CALL THE Draw() FUNCTION IN Game.DrawGame()"
"DO NOT FORGET TO CALL THE Draw() FUNCTION IN Game.DrawGame()"


Yeah you're so sure you called it?
"CHECK ANY DUPLICATE CALLS"
"CHECK ANY DUPLICATE CALLS"
"CHECK ANY DUPLICATE CALLS"
